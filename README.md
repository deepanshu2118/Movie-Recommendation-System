Overview
The Movie Recommender System utilizes machine learning to provide personalized movie recommendations. The system is designed to suggest movies that align with user preferences based on historical data and a trained model. The frontend is implemented using the Streamlit library, which allows for an interactive and intuitive user experience.

Features
Personalized Recommendations: Get movie suggestions based on your input preferences.
Streamlit Interface: Easy-to-use web interface for interacting with the recommender system.
Pre-trained Model: Use a machine learning model that has been trained and saved for predictions.
Simple Setup: Quick installation and setup process.
Installation
To get started with the Movie Recommender System, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/rjsandeepkumawat/movie_recommender.git
cd movie_recommender
Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install Dependencies:

Install the required libraries using the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Additional Pickle file:

pickle.dump(similarity,open('similarity.pkl','wb'))
Usage
To run the Movie Recommender System, follow these steps:

Ensure you are in the project directory.

Run the Streamlit App:

streamlit run app.py
Open the App:

After running the command, Streamlit will provide a local URL (e.g., http://localhost:8501) where you can view and interact with the movie recommender system.

Interact with the Interface:

Follow the instructions on the Streamlit interface to input your preferences and receive movie recommendations.

Files
app.py: The main script for running the Streamlit application. It contains the code for the frontend interface and the logic to interact with the recommender model.
model.pkl: The serialized machine learning model used for making recommendations. This file should be in the same directory as app.py for the application to function correctly.
requirements.txt: A file listing all the necessary Python packages required to run the application. It can be used with pip to install dependencies.
similarity.pkl: This file should be in the same directory as app.py for the application to function correctly.
app_background.jpg: This File is used for background in application you can choose your own by changing image path in app.py
